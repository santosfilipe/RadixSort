# Radix Sort

The purpose of the University class (Advanced Data Structures I) was to compare different sort algorithms and present an overview and an implementation of it to the class. I had to develop from scratch the implementation of the Radix Sort algorithm in Java.

More information regarding the Radix Sort algorithm can be found in the Wikipedia link below:
